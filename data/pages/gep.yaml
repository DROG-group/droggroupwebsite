    title: "Our Approach"
    items:
      - "DROG hired and promoted more women than men because DROG's a global, remote first, digital nomad, social business, open hiring teal company. And women tend to do much better in such environments."
      - "We're for gender equality, but not for outdated, polarizing gender stereotypes."
      - "We don't need to endorse salary systems that might favour dated role models or perpetuating old stereotypes. In the end you realise it's often the \"top down endorsing\" part is what keeps those very systems alive."

      - "We don't work when people are not healthy, or not well rested. We respect weekends."
