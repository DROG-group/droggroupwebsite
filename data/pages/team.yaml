  title: "Our Story"
  content: |
    DROG was founded with a simple but ambitious goal: to build the most effective community for countering disinformation in Europe and beyond.

    We recognized that fighting disinformation requires more than just fact-checking or media literacy. It demands a multi-generational approach that adapts to evolving threats and leverages diverse expertise.

    Through our DIM (Disinformation Intervention Model), we've mapped out five generations of counter-disinformation interventions, each responding to different challenges and paradigms. We're now pioneering Generation 5 "Interactivist" interventions that harness the power of group communication and social interaction.
