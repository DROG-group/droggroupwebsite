  <p>Your disinformation interventions must constantly deal with, and adapt to new circumstances, whilst taking on board scientific insights and field lab testing. We are currently exploring how to properly productise new additions to the disinformation intervention cookbook. Read more about these so-called "Interactivist" 5th-generation interventions.</p>

  <h2>What are Interactivist Interventions?</h2>
  <p>Interactivist interventions represent the fifth generation of counter-disinformation approaches in the DROG DIM model. Unlike previous generations that focused on individual cognition or information access, Interactivist interventions recognize that people change their minds mainly through interacting with other people.</p>

  <h2>The Core Insight</h2>
  <p>Under the right conditions, others can help us find errors in our beliefs, as we can help others find errors in theirs. This social dimension of belief change has been underutilized in counter-disinformation work until now.</p>

  <h2>Key Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Interaction First:</strong> Prioritizing group communication over individual education</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Design:</strong> Constantly evolving based on new circumstances and research</li>
    <li><strong>Scientific Foundation:</strong> Built on rigorous academic insights and field testing</li>
    <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Focused on productizing interventions for real-world deployment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Problem We're Addressing</h2>
  <p>Generation 5 interventions respond to societal alienation - the growing disconnect between people and communities that makes them vulnerable to disinformation. When people feel isolated, they become more susceptible to narratives that offer simple explanations and in-group belonging.</p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>We are developing interventions that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Facilitate meaningful conversations between people with different viewpoints</li>
    <li>Create spaces for collaborative fact-finding and error correction</li>
    <li>Build community resilience against manipulation</li>
    <li>Leverage social dynamics for positive change</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Join the Development</h2>
  <p>We're actively exploring and testing new Interactivist interventions. If you're interested in contributing as a practitioner, scientist, or creative tech, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

  <p>The cookbook is being written - and you can help shape the recipes.</p>
